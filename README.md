My implementation of Ray Tracing In One Weekend

"Ray Tracing in One Weekend" is an introduction to computer graphics raytracers, intended to be brief enough to complete within a single weekend. This repo is my implementation for the sake of 1) fun, 2) code practice, 3) review of cg methods, and 4) to have the guts of a cg tracer available later for toying around.
